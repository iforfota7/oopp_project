# Code of Conduct (ENG)

In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the collaboration. Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary. Think about what the best way would be to fill out the Code of Conduct with your group.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Assignment description: </span>\
Over the course of this assignment we plan to adhere to the principles of successful teamwork, which may include but are not limited to; having a professional attitude, working in an organised manner, providing constructive feedback, treating everyone respectfully and giving everyone the opportunity to contribute equally to the final product. Moreover, we aim to achieve new skills and abilities, including learning the technologies that will be used throughout the development of the product. For the client side of the application, we will extensively use JavaFX, which will provide us with basic user interface elements. Furthermore, Spring Boot will be used for the server side for handling the REST API and database. It is expected that everyone puts in individual effort in order to complete their work to the best of their ability before the specified deadline.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Target or ambition level: </span>\
We realise the importance of this course in the development of our technical and soft skills, which are essential for our future careers and personal development. Thus, we strive to complete the assignments to the best of our abilities and we plan on remaining ambitious throughout the entire project, meaning we would like to aim for a grade between a 9 and a 10.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Products: </span>\
At the end of the course, we wish to deliver a project that meets as many of the specifications set in the backlog as possible. The work to be submitted should use formal, clear and comprehensive language throughout all deliverables. Work on the non-code deliverables will be done in Google Drive in a folder that all members have access to. Once such a deliverable has been finished it will be submitted either to Brightspace, or to the team’s GitLab repository’s main branch, depending on the assignment instructions. Each member is responsible for contributing equally to the code of the project application. Code contributions should always be pushed to GitLab in designated separate branches with a title shortly describing the function of the code, be it implementing a new feature, writing unit tests, or fixing bugs. Any pushed code should be checked as to not fail the pipeline. Additionally, any code should meet the following checkstyle requirements to ensure a good quality of work (not necessarily in order of priority):
1. Include Javadoc for every method
2. Ensure that Javadoc is structured correctly (short description, @param, and @return tags)
3. Limit the length of methods to 50 lines
4. Limit the number of parameters in a method to 8
5. Limit cyclomatic complexity to a maximum of 9 
6. Ensure that all imports are required and used
7. Ensure double brackets are not used during initialization
8. Ensure the naming conventions for class member variables, such as fields and constants, as well as for local variables, such as those declared inside a method or block, are applied
9. Ensure the naming conventions for method names are applied
10. Ensure the naming conventions for the methods’ parameters are applied
11. Ensure the naming conventions for class member variables, such as fields and constants, are applied
12. Ensure the naming conventions for class, interface, and enum types are applied
13. Limit the line length of a method to 100 characters

Once a feature is fully implemented, a merge request (MR) should be created to merge the new branch with the developmental branch named “dev”.  Before this, dev should always be merged into the branch locally to resolve any conflicts that may arise. For creating an MR, it is important that the person fills out the details as much as possible, allowing for a better overview. This also allows other team members to better understand the feature that has been implemented, providing them a better basis from which to fully code review the work, a step that must always be completed before merging into dev. In a code review, a team member looks through another member's work, and comments on any lines of code that they think could cause issues, could be refactored, or that they don’t understand. The reviewer is also responsible for locally testing that the application runs according to expectations. Once all comments from the review have been resolved, the reviewer can approve the MR, allowing the branch to be merged.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Planning: </span>\
Throughout this project, we will be using an adapted version of Scram to guide our process and planning. Specifically, the backlog will be used to create a smaller sprint backlog every Tuesday after the meeting with the TA, which will be used to reflect on our progress. When creating this sprint backlog, each task will be assigned story points to determine the effort required to complete it within the next week. The tasks will be split so that each team member will have approximately the same number of story points to complete, resulting in an equal amount of work for everyone. If a team member believes that it is not possible for them to complete their individual task before the specified deadline, they should always report this to the other team members in a timely manner. In case the workload was not completable, the team should take this into account when assigning future story points and determining the amount of work that is included in the sprint backlog. 
 
<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Behaviour: </span>\
In this team, it is expected that all members treat each other with respect and dignity. For any possible disagreements, there should first be an attempt made to handle the conflict internally between the team members through discussions and general communication. All team members should always feel capable of expressing their opinions, and others are expected to listen. If members feel a conflict cannot be resolved independently by themselves, the TA should be contacted to reach an overall consensus. Similarly, if a member is late to a meeting this should first be handled between members. Only if a member is late to multiple meetings without giving a reason prior to the meetings start should the TA be informed and involved.  

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Communication: </span>\
During the project, multiple means of communication will be used. WhatsApp will be preferred for exchanging messages between team members, specifically for handling smaller concerns, updates and to plan future meetings. If something is unclear or cannot be answered using WhatsApp, Mattermost will be used by any team member to ask the TA for guidance. Lastly, if a member cannot be present in person for a meeting, or it was purposefully scheduled to be online, Discord should be used as a way to communicate between members.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Commitment: </span>\
In every meeting, it is expected that each member gives a short briefing about their completed work from the previous week. This allows other team members to gauge the progress of the project and give feedback to each team member, allowing for further improvements to the quality of their work. Additionally, the chair should prepare a proper agenda that suits the needs of the team for that specific week, ensuring all points to be discussed are listed in detail with the time to spend on them. The minute taker should document meetings in a clear and concise manner, following the outline of the agenda. 

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Division of tasks and roles: </span>\
To spread the workload and give everyone the opportunity to experience each role, the chair and minute taker will change every week according to the following table. It is expected that the chair prepares an agenda for each meeting they lead, while the minute taker is responsible for taking notes and keeping track of any assignments due in that week.

| Meeting date | Chair | Minute Taker |

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Meetings: </span>\
This team will be meeting twice a week on campus in Drebbelweg, once during Tuesday's lab and once on Thursdays after 13:45. Any additional meetings may be scheduled separately. If the Thursday meeting is not deemed necessary by general consensus it can be cancelled. In-person attendance is preferred but not required, however if attendance is not possible other members should be informed. It is expected that members have completed the required work before a meeting, so that they run smoothly. 

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Decision-making: </span>\
As a team, we strongly believe that reaching consensus in all of our decisions is ideal, so that everyone feels they are an essential part of the team and that their opinions are taken into account. Thus, participating constructively and respectfully in all team conflicts is essential and team members are encouraged to voice their opinions when they disagree with a group decision. In case general consensus cannot be reached, a majority vote will be used to make the final decision, which can be discussed and repeated until a majority is reached in case of a tie.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Guidance: </span>\
We expect our TA to provide us with further clarifications, to help us grasp the material, and to settle conflicts that cannot be solved by the team. Additionally we would appreciate formative feedback on both content and collaboration as we value both equally.   

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Consequences: </span>\
Generally, we as a team believe that there should always be an open conversation between members to ensure respect. If agreements are not upheld, members should therefore always be given the opportunity to explain. Any consequences to not keeping agreements will consequently depend on the situation. 

Specifically:
1. Time management concerns such as below will result in the member needing to bring snacks to the next meeting for everyone
    * missing or being late by more than 10 minutes to a meeting without prior notice
    * not having work completed in time or even missing an internal/external deadline without telling others beforehand
2. Concerns regarding a member's respect for others, such as those below, should be pointed out to the member after their occurrence as quickly as possible to give them a chance to improve
    * talking over others in meetings
    * not listening to others speak or even going against group decisions
    * ignoring others opinions or not reaching out for/listening to feedback 

Only if these concerns are exhibited repeatedly (more than 3 times) or to an extreme degree (judged by other affected team members) will the TA be informed, but this should come as a last resort. The resulting consequence for the team member should be agreed upon by the other members and the TA. 

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Dealing with Conflicts: </span>\
In the event that a conflict arises involving a team member, we shall promptly provide them with a verbal or written warning, articulating the problem and elucidating why their conduct was inappropriate. We expect all team members to exhibit a receptive attitude when receiving feedback, allowing for an amicable resolution to any issues that may surface. However, if this is not feasible and the disagreement persists, we will seek an impartial third party to provide a fair assessment, which will guide our next course of action.

After considering each team member's viewpoint on the matter and their proposed solutions, we will discuss the necessary consequences and hold a vote to determine the final decision. Should the situation warrant it, we may impose a probationary period, during which the member's conduct is carefully monitored to ensure compliance with the Code of Conduct.

In the unlikely event that the team member in question does not rectify their behaviour and further conflicts ensue, we will contact our TA and work together towards a resolution.


<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Success factors: </span>\
All participants of this team are ambitious, and as previously mentioned we realise the importance of this project and therefore plan to actively work on it together in order to achieve our goals. Additionally, we are all good listeners, which minimises the chance of conflicts, and we are a diverse team, as we all come from different backgrounds and possess different and unique skills, which combined together will ensure the success of our team.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Norms or evaluation criteria:
1. Dependability; keeping deadlines and being at meetings on time. We deeply value this since it establishes trust between all team members, facilitating better team work.

2. Communication; actively participating in meetings and trying to come up with ideas. Every person will have different ideas, so openly communicating is vital for the team to discuss and decide on the best plan of action.
3. Motivation and Interest; completing work to the best of your abilities with a high quality. This is important since we believe each member should be able to trust the other's work. This will only be possible if the work submitted by everyone is done to the highest standard possible for them.

4. Open Mindedness; being open to other ideas and received feedback. Since we are a diverse team, there is always the possibility of conflicts. To resolve these quickly without weakening trust in the other members, we think it is very necessary to remain open minded to others at all times.

5. Encouraging; actively trying to involve all team members and being respectful. This will facilitate a better environment in which everyone freely explores their ideas without being scared of judgement.
