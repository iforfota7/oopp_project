# Code of Conduct (ENG)

In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the collaboration. Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary. Think about what the best way would be to fill out the Code of Conduct with your group.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Team name: Group 64 </span>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Shared team values </span>:
1. Treating everyone with respect and being eager to listen to and value their ideas
2. Treating your part of the work responsibly and completing it to the best of your ability
3. Upholding good time management including keeping deadlines and being punctual to meetings

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Assignment description: </span>\
Over the course of this assignment we plan to adhere to the principles of successful teamwork, which may include but are not limited to; having a professional attitude, working in an organised manner, providing constructive feedback, treating everyone respectfully and giving everyone the opportunity to contribute equally to the final product. Moreover, we aim to achieve new skills and abilities, including learning the technologies that will be used throughout the development of the product. It is expected that everyone puts in individual effort in order to complete their work to the best of their ability before the specified deadline.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Target or ambition level: </span>\
We realise the importance of this course in the development of our technical and soft skills, which are essential for our future careers and personal development. Thus, we strive to complete the assignments to the best of our abilities and we plan on remaining ambitious throughout the entire project, meaning we would like to aim for a grade between a 9 and a 10.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Products: </span>\
At the end of the course, we wish to deliver a project that meets all the specifications set in the backlog. The work to be submitted should use formal, clear and comprehensive language throughout all deliverables.  The non-code deliverables of the project will be shared via Google Drive. Any code uploaded to GitLab should be well documented and meet all the requirements set for it in meetings and/or the backlog. Additionally, any code should meet the following checkstyle requirements to ensure a good quality of work (not necessarily in order of priority):
1. Use tab instead of spaces
2. Add whitespace before new sections of code
3. Limit the line length to 100 characters
4. Include Javadoc for every method
5. Limit cyclomatic complexity to a maximum of 10 
6. Use camel case for naming
7. Limit the number of parameters in a method to 6
8. Constant variables should adhere to the naming convention (all upper case separated by underscores)
9. Limit the length of methods to 50 lines
10. Ensure that all imports are required and used

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Planning: </span>\
Throughout this project, we will be using an adapted version of Scram to guide our process and planning. Specifically, the backlog will be used to create a smaller sprint backlog every Tuesday after the meeting with the TA, which will be used to reflect on our progress. When creating this sprint backlog, each task will be assigned story points to determine the effort required to complete it within the next week. The tasks will be split so that each team member will have approximately the same number of story points to complete, resulting in an equal amount of work for everyone. If a team member believes that it is not possible for them to complete their individual task before the specified deadline, they should always report this to the other team members in a timely manner. In case the workload was not completable, the team should take this into account when assigning future story points and determining the amount of work that is included in the sprint backlog. 
 
<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Behaviour: </span>\
In this team, it is expected that all members treat each other with respect and dignity. For any possible disagreements, there should first be an attempt made to handle the conflict internally between the team members through discussions and general communication. All team members should always feel capable of expressing their opinions, and others are expected to listen. If members feel a conflict cannot be resolved independently by themselves, the TA should be contacted to reach an overall consensus. Similarly, if a member is late to a meeting this should first be handled between members. Only if a member is late to multiple meetings without giving a reason prior to the meeting start should the TA be informed and involved. 

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Communication: </span>\
During the project, multiple means of communication will be used. WhatsApp will be preferred for exchanging messages between team members, specifically for handling smaller concerns, updates and to plan future meetings. If something is unclear or cannot be answered by members using WhatsApp, Mattermost will be used to ask the TA for guidance. Lastly, if a member cannot be present in person for a meeting, or it was purposefully scheduled to be online, Discord should be used as a way to communicate between members.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Commitment: </span>\
In every meeting, it is expected that each member gives a short briefing about their completed work from the previous week. This allows other team members to gauge the progress of the project and give feedback to each team member, allowing for further improvements to the quality of their work. Additionally, the chair should prepare a proper agenda that suits the needs of the team for that specific week and the minute taker should document meetings in a clear and concise manner and upload all documents before the deadline. 

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Division of tasks and roles: </span>\
To spread the workload and give everyone the opportunity to experience each role, the chair and minute taker will change every week according to the following table (week 9 to be decided a few days prior to the meeting). It is expected that the chair prepares an agenda for each meeting they lead, while the minute taker is responsible for taking notes and uploading any assignments due in that week to Brightspace.

| Meeting date | Chair | Minute Taker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 21.02.2023 (week 2) | Lazar | Ioana |
| 28.02.2023 (week 3) | Emilia | Tudor |
| 07.03.2023 (week 4) | Ziliang | Dimitar |
| 21.03.2023 (week 6) | Dimitar | Ziliang |
| 28.03.2023 (week 7) | Tudor | Emilia |
| 04.04.2023 (week 8) | Ioana | Lazar |

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Meetings: </span>\
This team will be meeting twice a week on campus in Drebbelweg, once during Tuesday's lab and once on Thursdays after 13:45. Any additional meetings may be scheduled separately. If the Thursday meeting is not deemed necessary by general consensus it can be cancelled. In-person attendance is preferred but not required, however if attendance is not possible other members should be informed. It is expected that members have completed the required work before a meeting, so that they run smoothly. 

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Decision-making: </span>\
As a team, we strongly believe that reaching consensus in all of our decisions is ideal, so that everyone feels they are an essential part of the team and that their opinions are taken into account. Thus, participating constructively and respectfully in all team conflicts is essential and team members are encouraged to voice their opinions when they disagree with a group decision. In case general consensus cannot be reached, a majority vote can be used to make the final decision.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Guidance: </span>\
We expect our TA to provide us with further clarifications, to help us grasp the material, and to settle conflicts that cannot be solved by the team. Additionally we would appreciate formative feedback on both content and collaboration as we value both equally.  

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Consequences: </span>\
Generally, we as a team believe that there should always be an open conversation between members to ensure respect. If agreements are not upheld, members should therefore always be given the opportunity to explain. Any consequences to not keeping agreements will consequently depend on the situation. 

Specifically:
1. Time management concerns such as below will result in the member needing to bring snacks to the next meeting for everyone
    * missing or being late by more than 10 minutes to a meeting without prior notice
    * not having work completed in time or even missing an internal/external deadline
2. Concerns regarding a member's respect for others, such as those below, should be pointed out to the member after their occurrence as quickly as possible to give them a chance to improve
    * talking over others in meetings
    * not listening to others speak or even going against group decisions
    * ignoring others opinions or not reaching out for/listening to feedback 

Only if these concerns are exhibited repeatedly (more than 3 times) or to an extreme degree (judged by other affected team members) will the TA be informed, but this should come as a last resort. The resulting consequence for the team member should be agreed upon by the other members and the TA. 

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Success factors: </span>\
All participants of this team are ambitious, and as previously mentioned we realise the importance of this project and therefore plan to actively work on it together in order to achieve our goals. Additionally, we are all good listeners, which minimises the chance of conflicts, and we are a diverse team, as we all come from different backgrounds and possess different and unique skills, which combined together will ensure the success of our team.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255)"> Norms or evaluation criteria:
1. Dependability: keeping deadlines and being at meetings on time
2. Communication: actively participating in meetings and trying to come up with ideas
3. Motivation and Interest: completing work to the best of your abilities with a high quality
4. Open Mindedness: being open to other ideas and received feedback
5. Encouraging: actively trying to involve all team members and being respectful
