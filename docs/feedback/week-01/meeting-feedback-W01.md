# Feedback Week 1
### 1) Self-organization
#### Excellent
- Everyone was friendly to each other and we had a good discussion about expectations for the following project.
- People informed one another without me needing to explicitly say something.
- Some people took more initative with the discussion and asked more questions. This could be more evened out in the following weeks.
### 2) Suggested Topics
#### Good
- CoC was discussed and also a bit about backlog.
- People generally understood what the assignment is and we had a good discussion about what topics should be expanded upon in the following QnA.
- Not much moderation from the team but it is still week 1.
