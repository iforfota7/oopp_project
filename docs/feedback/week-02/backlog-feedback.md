## Backlog Feedback

### Submission

>Mark: **Pass**

Feedback: 
- I like that it is in markdown and it has good formatting and structure.
- I like that you included mockups.

### Backlog Structure

>Mark: **Pass** (FAIL next week!)

Feedback: This is a pass for now, because the content and mocks are very good, and based on my mistake to suggest MOSCOW, however I do ask you to modify it accordingly to the feedback for the deadline in order to pass.
#### Tops:
- The terminology is clear, the user stories are good.
- You have pretty good acceptance criteria.
#### Tips:
- However, you should not have used MOSCOW, you should have had an Epic list with descriptions and a list of user stories that prioritises those epics.
- A mistake on my part, can be fixed by next week.


### Epics

>Mark: **Insufficient**

Feedback: Is in MOSCOW format, so it does not have any mention of epics.
#### Tips:
- Parse from MOSCOW to Epics by final deadline.


### User Stories

>Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: The user stories are quite clear and they cover quite atomic things, however some of them have unclear wording and can be reformulated.
#### Tops:
- Very in depth but has the neccesary information to make them clear.
- I like that you have made them pretty atomic (the scope is good).
#### Tips:
- You could rewrite some of them that might be unclear or are written badly (*to make a board my current board by clicking on it*).


### Acceptance Criteria

>Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: Very good and clear subpoints!
#### Tops:
- I like that you talk about "having a permanent effect".
- **Good**: The size is either small or they are explained in subsections.
