# Code of conduct Feedback
### Submission

>Mark: **Pass**

Feedback:
#### Tops:
- I like that you did it in markdown, and it looks really nice! Also, great effort!
#### Tips:
- Markdown formatting can be improved though.
- It would be great to make your gitlab uploading process smoother, by having an admin branch that you always push to or by tagging the relevant commits (the ones that address a deadline).

### General
>Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: Very good base but you can improve it as you evolve as a team during this quarter!
#### Tops:
- Clear, well-written.
- Concrete.
- Reasonable.
#### Tips:
- Some motivation missing, read tips bellow.

### Assignment Description

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback: In terms of teamwork, your description of the assignment seems well written and reasonable without being too long, however you still need to add some details about the assignment in terms of coding, product etc.
#### Tops:
- I like that it is based on the learning objectives but also on personal ethos.
- It has a lot of information regarding what you need to do and to learn in this course.
#### Tips:
- However, it has no information about the coding part of the assignment.

### Products

>Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: Very clear and concrete description of your products and deliverables, however it is quite long and I don't think you need to specify checkstyle rules here as long as you have them in your project checkstyle, and you agree with them in the CoC.
#### Tops:
- Product description is very good and clear.
- I also like that you included product quality (documentation, code style).
#### Tips:
- However, I don't think you should write all your checkstyle rules in this section.

### Planning

>Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: This section is very exact and well written, so pretty hard to complain here. I think some things will be added when you learn how the coding review process works.

### Communication

>Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: You included pretty much every communication method or channel you are going to use, however you did not taLk about how you are contacting the TA and in what circumstances.
#### Tops:
- Very good that u mentioned the communication channels for each scenario
#### Tips:
- Could be a little more exact with how do you plan to communicate with the TA through mattermost (one person speaks for the team on the group?).


### Commitment

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback: It is good that you mention that you expect your chairman to give the briefing and the agenda, and the note taker to take notes. However, you can go even further by specifying how you would like the chairman and note-taker to do this. For example, what is the standard of quality you expect from the notes taken by the minute taker?
#### Tops:
- Mentions the minimum that each member has to contribute.
#### Tips:
- Does not mention anything related to how you would like the chairman and note taker to perform (how do they take notes? what should the agenda have?)

### Division of Tasks and Roles
  
>Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: This is a very organised way of selecting the roles each week, and it also makes sure everyone covers the role at least once. To make this even better, you need to have some indication of this in GitLab, i.e. have an issue and mr assigned to the chairman and secretary where you upload the relevant documents.
#### Tops:
- The table is very good.
#### Tips:
- It would be nice to reflect it on gitlab in an issue.

### Meetings

>Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: This has enough thought on *how* you plan the non-TA meetings, but you should add more in *what* you will prepare then. 
#### Tops:
- A quite detailed way to plan new meetings.
#### Tips:
- You could mention what you will discuss in the non-TA meetings and how to prepare for them (is the chairman the same person?).

### Decision-Making

>Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: Well expressed process, but it does not cover every type of problem you may encounter when needing to vote.
#### Tops:
- Concrete decision-making process.
#### Tips:
- Does not include the scenario where there is a tie in majority vote.

### Dealing with Conflicts

>Mark: **Insufficient**

Feedback: 
- This section does not exist in the final backlog.

### Guidance
  
>Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: 
- Seems reasonable and it was discussed previously.

### Consequences
>Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: You took the feedback well here and improved this section a lot, which makes it very beneficial and concrete. You still can add more scenarios to cover every front.
#### Tops:
- Covers a lot of scenarios and is decently exact.
#### Tips:
- Does not cover the case that none of this happens, but it is still signaled to be a problem.

### Success Factors

>Mark: **Very Good**

### Norms or Evaluation Criteria

>Mark: **Good**

Feedback: 
- The criteria are good, but you have to have an explanation for each one you wrote.
