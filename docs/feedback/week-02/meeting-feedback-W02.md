## Formative Assessment Week 2
- **Chair**: Lazar
- **Notetaker**: Ioana


### Meeting Organization

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback:
- They could make it more clear who the chair and note taker is.


### Agenda

Mark: **Sufficient**

Feedback:
#### Tops:
- Added timeslots.
- Good structure.
#### Tips:
- Too generic (could have added more in depth points about the CoC, Backlog, Features discussion).
- Chairman is not specified.
- Very few minutes allocated for the TA Feedback.
- Feels like they just took the template and added on top, the template has to be used as a guideline and adapted to the specific week.

### Chair performance

Mark: **Sufficient**

Feedback: 
- They could have been more active in managing the amount of time each person spoke.
- They were good enough in mananging time allocation, but this can improve.
- **Very good**: They guided the conversation to the topics in the agenda.

### Time management

Mark: **Good**

Feedback:
- Mostly kept the discussion along the lines of the agenda time slots, with some differences. (Like less time allocated to opening)
- Added some things not included in the agenda, the agenda should me more complete.

### Minute taker performance

Mark: **Good**

Feedback:
- Notes pretty comprehensive, would be better with formatting.

### Relation

Mark: **Good**

Feedback:

- **Very good**: They helped each other with questions regarding the backlog features etc. without me needing to interfere.
- They have already started talking about more advanced implementation details **-> this can be a contrapoint as well**.
- **Tip**: Too much dependance on information from each other, they should ask me more on stuff that is unclear. **(I am a tool)**
- **Important**: Some people are quiet, they should evolve during the weeks to contribute more to the discussion. The chairman sould make the meeting should be more balanced.
- They should be more energetic.
